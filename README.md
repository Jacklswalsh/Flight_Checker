# Flight_Checker
Used flighttracker_tracker.py with Cron to scrape prices once/twice per day. 
Stored inside flighttracker_results.csv
Graphed/Displayed using flighttracker_grapher.py and flighttracker_dash.py

Results are included from an  period, shortly before I flew to Canada, when the prices were fluctuating wildly. At this time AirCanada was the only provider still flying; when other airlines announced the reintroduction of routes from London to Toronto, fluctuations in AirCanada prices stabalised - Interesting!
